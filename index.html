            <p>Hello, I am an mmd student studying in Copenhagen. Aside from studying I like playing games from time to time, even though I don’t play all the latest games that come out, I always watch reviews of them and i pretty much know everything about them.I mostly like the games that look pretty, meaning that I like the games that have nice graphics aside from nice gameplay. My favorite game genre is shooter games. I like a lot war games and battlefield IV is my favorite game of all times.</p>

            <p>I am a student of multimedia design. I like to spend my free time with painting, drawing or playing video games. I’m very picky with games, my prefference is non-hiperrealistic look and interesting storyline. My favourite games are Skyrim, Beyond good and evil, Spyro and Lego series.</p>
