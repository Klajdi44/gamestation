            <p>Hello, I am an student studying in Copenhagen. Aside from studying I like playing games from time to time, even though I don’t play all the latest games that come out, I know a lot about them.I mostly like the games that look pretty, meaning that I like the games that have nice graphics aside from nice gameplay. My favorite game  battlefield IV.</p>

            <p>Currently studying MMD along with my fellow team members. I like innovation and great ideas. I love to play around by coding. Last but not least, I enjoy some good relaxation that games offer. League of Legends, World of Warcraft and other single-player games with graphics worth big awards.</p>

            <p>I am a student of multimedia design. I like to spend my free time with painting, drawing or playing video games. I’m very picky with games, my prefference is non-hiperrealistic look and interesting storyline. My favourite games are Skyrim, Beyond good and evil, Spyro and Lego series.</p>
